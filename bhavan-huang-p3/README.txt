Hans Bhavan 811-408-544
Kenny Huang 811-363-660

Hans made the files size.cpp and newer.cpp

Kenny made the files dirlist.cpp and forkpid.cpp

Both partners upheld their individual commitments, completing each program on 
time and testing it to make sure they compile and run successfully.

Code instructions:

1. Make sure you are in the bhavan-huang-p3 directory
2. Type 'make' to compile the code
3. Type 'make clean' to leave just the .cpp files
3. To run the programs:
	a. To print the size of a file
		./size [file1]
	b. To print the size of multiple files and their total size
		./size [file1] [file2] ...
	c. To print the size of standard input
		./size
	
	d. To compare the access time of two files
		./newer -a [file1] [file2]
	e. To compare the modify time of two files
		./newer -m [file1] [file2]
	f. To compare the create time of two files
		./newer -c [file1] [file2]
	
	g. To display all the files in the current working directory
		./dirlist
	
	h. To run the forkpid utility
		./forkpid

	i. Three sample test files are included to run with size.cpp and newer.cpp
		test1.txt	test2.txt	test3.txt
